This is a digital diary for contact information. In this diary you can add new contact information. See them anytime you want. And you can also search any contact (according to different categories ) from the vast list of contacts you have saved. Even if you forget something and make a mistake during the search, it will guess the correct result and show it to you

There is a info.txt file which holds all your contact information. I initially saved my contact info in the file. If you cant to start fresh you can delete that and make it a blac=nk txt file
For executing the program you must execute prototype3.py file.
at first you will be given 3 choices: the search any contact you have already saved, to add a new contact and to see all the contacts already saved

IF you choose 3: It will show you the contacts that are already saved in your directory

If you choose 2: It will ask you how many person you want to add in the directory. Then it will ask for particular information about that person, like First name, mail etc

If you choose 1: You can search any contact you want to find. You can search by first name,last name. Or if you remember any other details like phone no or mail, you can also search. It will give you the full info of that person.
During search, if you make slight mistakes, it can guess the correct result that you are looking for.

happy coding
